# Sales Ops FAQ Bot (Month 1 Project)

## Problem Statement
Sales Ops teams waste significant time searching scattered CPQ documentation 
to answer routine questions, slowing down deal cycles and causing inconsistent 
responses â€” a reliable FAQ bot can cut search time and improve efficiency.

## Goal (Month 1)
Deliver a working Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) FAQ bot using synthetic 
CPQ docs, with evaluation, UAT checklist, personas, PRD, and demo video.
