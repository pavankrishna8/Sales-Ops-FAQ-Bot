# Sales Ops FAQ Bot (Month 1 Project)

## Problem Statement
Sales Ops teams waste significant time searching scattered CPQ documentation 
to answer routine questions, slowing down deal cycles and causing inconsistent 
responses — a reliable FAQ bot can cut search time and improve efficiency.

## Goal
Deliver a working Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) FAQ bot using synthetic 
CPQ docs, with evaluation, UAT checklist, personas, PRD, and demo video.

## Success Metrics
- Bot answers ≥70% of test queries correctly.
- Hallucination rate <15%.
- Response time <3 seconds per query.
- Deliverables: PRD, personas, user stories, UAT checklist, evaluation report, demo  video, and clean GitHub repo.
- Project demo-ready for mentors/stakeholders (clear run instructions + short video).
